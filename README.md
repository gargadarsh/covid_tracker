# COVID-19 Tracker and Prediction Algorithm Using Voice Assistant
## Description 
    
    Voice Assistant provides COVID-19 metrics with the use of a 
    voice assistant.
        
    Program uses methods of speech recognition and regex to analyze
    voice input.

## Current Developments

    Adding Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to output data that 
    can be useful to individual users of this application
    
    Adding Neural Networks to predict certain outputs given features of 
    coronavirus, symptoms, patient experiences through data analysis and
    outputs potential infection, death, and recovery data.
    
##Implementation
    Coming soon!
