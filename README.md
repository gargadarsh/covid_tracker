# COVID-19 Tracker and Prediction Algorithm Using Voice Assistant

## Getting Started
    These instructions will help you get started with deploying this program onto your local machine.
    Follow the <a>Instructions<\a> section to set up your environment.

## Description 
    
    Voice Assistant provides COVID-19 metrics with the use of a 
    voice assistant.
        
    Program uses methods of speech recognition and regex to analyze
    voice input.

## Current Developments

    Adding Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to output data that 
    can be useful to individual users of this application
    
    Adding Neural Networks to predict certain outputs given features of 
    coronavirus, symptoms, patient experiences through data analysis and
    outputs potential infection, death, and recovery data.
    
## Installing
    
    First to set up your Environment:
    Independently install the following packages by using pip; to do this
    go to your terminal and type each line of code 
    
    NOTE: If you have trouble install pyaudio, run the command below first (for Macs only!)
    brew portaudio
        
### <li>Windows
    
    pip install ywin32
    pip install requests
    pip install SpeechRecognition
    pip install pyaudio
    
### <li>Mac
    
    pip install requests
    pip install SpeechRecognition
    pip pyaudio
    
    
## Implementation
    Coming soon!

    Inspiration
    Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).

    See if you can find any other trends in heart data to predict certain cardiovascular events or find any clear indications of heart health.
